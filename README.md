# Medical Care 2 You

An uber inspired app that let's users book non-emergency medical services.

## Summary

mc2u is a mobile application that connects someone who is sick to a localised network of medical practitioners, who are looking to generate additional income during their downtime. This will be similar to hailing a ride on Uber, in that the person who is sick can send an alert to a network of nearby medical professionals, who can then provide aid to that person at their location.
